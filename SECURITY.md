* Students
* Teaching Assistants
* Project Maintainers

**3. Security Principles**

* **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive information, such as student data, project credentials, and any confidential materials.
* **Integrity:** Maintain the accuracy and completeness of the project's code, data, and learning resources.
* **Availability:** Ensure the continuous and uninterrupted availability of the learning resources and the project's infrastructure.
* **Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their duties.
* **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls to mitigate risks.
* **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments, including vulnerability scans and code reviews.

**4. Security Practices**

* **Secure Coding Practices:** 
    * Follow secure coding guidelines and best practices.
    * Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    * Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * Use strong encryption for sensitive data (if applicable).
    * Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Development Lifecycle:** 
    * Integrate security considerations into all phases of the project development and maintenance.
    * Conduct security reviews at key stages (e.g., design, code reviews, testing).
* **Secure Infrastructure:** 
    * Implement strong access controls for all infrastructure components (if applicable).
    * Regularly patch and update operating systems and software.
    * Monitor system logs for suspicious activity.
* **Incident Response:** 
    * Establish clear incident response procedures to handle security breaches effectively.
    * Conduct regular incident response drills to test and improve response times.

**5. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Instructors:** Responsible for promoting secure coding practices among students and ensuring that security considerations are integrated into the learning materials.
* **Students:** Responsible for adhering to secure coding practices in their lab exercises and for reporting any suspected security vulnerabilities.
* **Teaching Assistants:** Responsible for assisting students with security-related questions and providing guidance on secure coding practices.
* **Project Maintainers:** Responsible for maintaining the security of the project's infrastructure and ensuring that the project adheres to security best practices.

**6. Compliance**

This policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it remains relevant and effective. All individuals involved in the Labs Spring Boot project are expected to comply with this policy.

**7. Violations**

Violations of this security policy will be investigated and may result in appropriate disciplinary action.
